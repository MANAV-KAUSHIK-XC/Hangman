Unnecessary blah blah about to follow, no need to read if you don't want to.

faqs:

Q: So, why did I decide to make Hangman?
A: Well it improves vocabulary and sppeling. Also good demostration of Swing and OOP. Different Objects handling game logic and GUI.

Q: Is'nt it too simple? 
A: Yea it is. But I have implemebted it in a complex way. It would have only taken about 30 minutes to make it with command line interface. 
But kids nowadays are SO DUMB they dont know wtf a terminal/command line is. And as a bonus its also resizable. I spent 3x the time required 
to make it resizable. SO RESIZE IT AND SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS IF YOU DONT I WILL BE VERY SAD.

Q: Darkmode when?
A: Never.

Q: You suck.
A: Same to you
